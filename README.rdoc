= Besouro

Besouro is an adaptation of Zorro[http://www.citeulike.org/group/3370/tag/zorro], an automated TDD behaviour recognizer. 
(The original SDSA/Zorro code was obtained from here[http://code.google.com/p/hackystat-ui-zorro/].)

The main difference between them, so far, is that Zorro relies on Hackystat[http://www.hackystat.org/] and Besouro is a stand-alone Eclipse Plugin.

Besouro was initially built to make the Zorro's rule system available for a TDD empirical evaluation, once it became obsolete since Hackystat evolved to it's new architecture, on version 8.


= Compiling and installing

Besouro was created as a plain eclipse plugin. Please refer to its documentation in order to build and install it.

In order to compile/execute it, you will need to download by yourself the JESSEngine[http://www.jessrules.com/].
