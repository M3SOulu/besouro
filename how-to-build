How To Build Besouro

First of all, you need to download the Eclipse SDK, containing the Eclipse Plug-in Development Environment (PDE). 
You can download it from http://www.eclipse.org/pde/

Download Besouro's source files from https://github.com/brunopedroso/besouro. 
You can simply download the files, you can perform a 'git clone' if you want to modify it, 
or you can form it in github if you intend to contribute your changes back to Besouro.

When you open the project in the SDK it should present you an error because of a missing library.
It is the Jess Rule engine, which, until the time of this writing could not be redistributed
due to it's not open-source license. You should be able to download it from [http://www.jessrules.com/].

(Besouro uses JESS because it is derived from Zorro [http://code.google.com/p/hackystat-ui-zorro/].
It would be great to provide a binary distribution of besouro, ready for use. Or at least to
provide all its dependencies with the source code. But now it is impossible due to Jess License.
If someone wants to help replacing Jess from Besouro without breaking any test, please let me know!)

After you ask for permisson and get access to your copy of Jess library, you can simply put it
into the 'lib' folder inside Besouro project, and it should compile successfully after a refresh
in Eclipse.
